# Papers related to the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service evolution - based on the project ECoLaSS

Selection of papers on the evolution of Copernicus Land Monitoring Services, in order to include the time series produced by the Sentinel constellations, based on the H2020 ECoLaSS ("Evolution of COpernicus Land Services based on Sentinel data") led by GAF in a consortium including SIRS, Johanneum Research, Universit√© Catholique de Louvain and the German Aerospace Center - DLR (Jan. 2017 - Dec. 2019).

The study undergone in the framework of ECoLaSS focused on the HR Layers, comprised of:
  - IMPerviousness (status and change) layers;
  - FORest (status and change) layers;
  - GRAsslands (status and change) layers
and on the feasibility of new generation of products, such as PHEnological and AGRIcultural activities, as well as CLC+.

# Preliminary skeleton:

1. Sentinel satellites characteristics
  - Sentinel-1 A/B
  - Sentinel-2 A/B
  - Sentinel-3 A/B
2. Fusion characteristics
  - Sentinel-1/Sentinel2
  - Sentinel-2/Sentinel-3
3. Thematic Classification State-of-the-Art
  - Urban mapping (IMP products)
  - Forest mapping (FOR products)
  - Grasslands mapping (GRA products)
  - Agricultural mapping
  - LC/LU Wall-to-wall mapping (CLC+ products)
4. Change Detection State-of-the-Art
5. Publications related to the project ECoLaSS
